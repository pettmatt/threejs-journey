## To note

React three fiber does a lot of heavylifting, which is why the developer can focus on what is important, the project. Boilerplate is reduced to almost nothing, which means the project doesn't need a camera in the scene, developer doesn't need to think about what the project should do if window is resized and a lot more. Over all the project is a lot more convenient to work with in React three fiber than in vanilla javascript environment.
